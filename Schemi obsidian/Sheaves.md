#Sheaves 

A subpresheaf of a sheaf is a sheaf iff it's closed under gluing.

$\ker_\Sh=\ker_\Pre$

Sheafification
- Universal, basically the "smallest sheaf with the same stalks".
- $\Sh(X)$ is abelian category (same as $\Pre(X)$ but you sheafify colimits) and you get stuff working stalk-wise.
- $(\bigoplus \Fc_i)_p=\bigoplus (\Fc_i)_p$ (colimit so I had to sheafify), for infinite product this does not work.
