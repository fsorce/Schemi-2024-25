More general category / Local on base (LB), local on domain (LD) / Inv. under [[Base change]] (BC)

$\Pc$ is local on the base if
1. If $f:X\to Y$ has $\Pc$ then $\rbar{f}_{f\ii(V)}$ has $\Pc$ for every $V\subseteq Y$ open
2. If $Y$ has an open cover $\cpa{V_i}$ and $f:X\to Y$ is such that $\rbar f_{f\ii(V_i)}$ has $\Pc$ for all $i$ then $f$ has $\Pc$.

$\Pc$ is local on the domain if
1. If $f:X\to Y$ has $\Pc$, $U\subseteq X,V\subseteq Y$ open such that $f(U)\subseteq V$ then $\rbar{f}_{U}:U\to V$ has $\Pc$.
2. If $X$ has an open cover $\cpa{U_i}$ and $f:X\to Y$ is such that $\rbar f_{U_i}$ has $\Pc$ for all $i$ then $f$ has $\Pc$.
