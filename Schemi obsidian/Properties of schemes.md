#PropertiesSchemes

Let $X$ be a scheme over a field $k$. $X$ is geometrically $\Pc$ if $X_{k'}$ has $\Pc$ for all field extensions $k'/k$.

Many come from [[Properties of Morphisms]] if we fix a target (usually the base scheme)

Algebraic conditions:
- [[Reduced schemes]]
- [[Noetherian schemes]]

Algebro/topological conditions:
- [[Geometrically connected]]
- [[Irreducible]]
- [[Integral schemes]]

Regularity:
- [[Normal schemes]]
- [[Regular schemes]]
- [[Smooth schemes]]
