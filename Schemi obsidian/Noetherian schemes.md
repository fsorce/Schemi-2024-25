Locally Noetherian: 
- for all **affine open** $U$, $\Oc(U)$ is Noetherian
- there is an open cover of spectra of Noetherian rings
Noetherian: 
- locally Noetherian and [[Quasi-compact]].
- there is a **finite** open cover of spectra of Noetherian rings
It follows that $\Pj^n_R$ is Noetherian when $R$ is Noetherian.

A Noetherian scheme is a Noetherian topological space.

[[Closed subschemes]] of a (locally) Noetherian schemes are (locally) Noetherian.
It follows that projective schemes are Noetherian.


If $X$ is Noetherian and $U\subseteq X$ open then $U$ is also Noetherian. It follows that $U\subseteq X$ is [[Quasi-separated]] and [[Quasi-compact]] (because every open subset of $U$ is quasi-compact), so [[Pushforward]] of [[Quasi-Coherent sheaves]] yields quasi-coherent sheaves.
