A scheme is quasi-compact iff it is a finite union of affine open subschemes.

A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is quasi-compact if for all quasi-compact open $V\subseteq Y$ we have that $f\ii(V)$ is quasi-compact. WLOG we may just check $V$ affine open.

Quasi-compactness of a morphism is local con the base:
- $X\to Y$ with $X$ quasi-compact and $Y$ affine must be a quasi-compact morphism
- check the locality with an **affine** cover of the base.
- For an arbitrary cover refine it to an affine cover.
