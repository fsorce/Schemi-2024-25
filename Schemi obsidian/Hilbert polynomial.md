#Cohomology 

Fix $\Fc\in \Coh(\Pj^n_k)$. The function $\Z\to \Z$ given by $t\mapsto \chi(\Fc(t))$ is a polynomial $H_\Fc\in \Q[t]$, called Hilbert polynomial. Moreover, the degree $r$ of $H_\Fc$ is the [[Dimension]] $\dim \Supp\Fc$ and the leading coefficient is of the form $d/r!$ for $d$ positive integer, which we call the **degree** of $\Fc$.
- By [[Flat base change]] we know that $\chi(\Fc(t))=\chi(\Fc_{\ol k}(t))$ so WLOG we assume $k=\ol k$.
- Proceed by induction on $r=\dim \Supp \Fc$:
	- If $r=0$ then $\Fc=\bigoplus_{p\in \Supp \Fc}{i_p}_\ast \Fc_p$. Since $\Oc(t)$ is invertible and the support is made up of isolated points we have that $\Fc(t)\cong \Fc$, so $\chi(\Fc(t))$ is constant.
	- Let $H\subseteq \Pj^n_k$ be an hyperplane. Tensoring $0\to \Oc(-1)\to \Oc\to \Oc_H\to 0$ with $\Fc(t)$ we get $\Fc(t-1)\to \Fc(t)\to (\Fc\otimes\Oc_H)(t)\to 0$
	- Note that $\Supp(\Fc\otimes\Oc_H)=H\cap \Supp \Fc$ (*Nakayama* to say $M_p=0\coimplies M\otimes k(p)=0$ and thus $M_p\otimes N_p=0\coimplies M_p=0$ or $N_p=0$ because of dimension) so if $H$ avoids the [[Points of a scheme|generic points]] of the irreducible components of $\Supp \Fc$ we have that $\dim(\Fc\otimes\Oc_H)=r-1$, on which we can apply the inductive hypothesis (it would be a polynomial of degree $r-1$ and leading coefficient $\frac d{(r-1)!}$).
	- **If $\Fc(t-1)\to \Fc(t)$ was injective** (or, equivalently since $\Oc(-t)$ is locally free, if $\Fc(-1)\to \Fc$ was injective) we would be done because in that case $$\chi(\Fc(t))-\chi(\Fc(t-1))=\chi(\Fc\otimes\Oc_H(t))$$and so $\chi(\Fc(t))$ must also be a numerical polynomial of degree $(r-1)+1$ and same leading coefficient except for the factor of $1/r$ (theory of numerical polynomials).
	- Suppose $H$ has equation $h\in H^0(\Oc(1))$, then $\Fc(-1)\to \Fc$ is the map induced by multiplication with $h$. This map is injective exactly when $h(x)\in \Oc_{\Pj^n,x}$ is not a zero divisor for all $x\in \Supp\Fc$. 
	- This means that $h$ is not an element of any [[Points of a scheme|associated point]] of $\Supp \Fc$ (zero divisors are the union of the associated primes). Equivalently, $H$ does not pass through any associated point of $\Supp \Fc$.
	- Since $\Fc$ is coherent, open affine subsets contain only a finite amount of associated points of $\Supp \Fc$, and since $\Pj^n$ is quasi-compact, this means that *the total amount of associated points is finite*.
	- Since $k=\ol k$, the field is infinite, so we can choose $H$ that avoids all associated points of $\Supp \Fc$.


If $i:X\to \Pj^n_k$ is a [[Closed subschemes|closed subscheme]], the degree of $X$ in $\Pj^n_k$ is set to be the degree of the sheaf $i_\ast\Oc_X$.


If $\Fc\in \Coh(\Pj^n_k)$ and $V$ is an irreducible component of $\Supp \Fc$ then the multiplicity of $\Fc$ in $V$ is $\mu_V(\Fc)=\length_{\Oc_{X,V}}(F_V)$. 

If $m=\dim \Supp \Fc$ and $V_1,\cdots, V_r$ are the irreducible components of $\Supp \Fc$ of dimension $m$ then the have that $\displaystyle \deg \Fc=\sum_{i=1}^r\mu_{V_i}(\Fc)\deg V_{i}$.
- We actually prove that if $\Supp \Gc\subseteq S$, $\dim S=m$ then $\chi(\Gc(t))=\frac{d}{m!}t^m+\cdots$ and $d=\sum \mu_{V_i}(\Gc)\deg V_i$ where $V_i$ are the irred. comp. of $S$ of dimension $m$ now and $\mu_{V_i}(\Gc)$ is the length as $\Oc_{X,V_i}$-module.
- If $0\to F'\to F\to F''\to 0$ and the result holds for $F'$ and $F''$ then it also holds for $F$.
- If the result holds for $F$ then it also holds for $F(t)$ for all $t\in \Z$ because $F_{V_i}\cong (F(t))_{V_i}$ and $(s-t)^m=s^m+o(s^{m-1})$.
- We proceed by induction on the value $d=d(\Gc):=\sum \mu_{V_i}(\Gc)\deg V_i$ (we prove for all $\Gc$ such that...)
	- $d=0$ implies that $\dim \Supp \Gc<m$ and so that coefficient is also $0$.
	- By the [[Theorem A of Serre]] $\Gc(t)$ is generated by global sections for some $t$. 
	- Take $s$ global section. $s:\Oc_{\Pj^n}\to \Gc(t)$ and the image is a subsheaf of $\Gc(t)$, so the support lives in $S$. 
	- Suppose that $s_{V_i}\neq 0$ ($V_i\subseteq \Supp \Gc=\Supp \Gc(t)$ so some section doesn't vanish if generated by global sections).
	- The image of $s:\Oc\to \Gc(t)$ is a quotient of $\Oc$, so it is of the form $\Oc_T$ with $V_i\subseteq T\subseteq S$.
	- We get $0\to \Oc_T\to \Gc(t)\to Q\to 0$. By construction $d(Q)<d(\Gc(t))=d$, so it falls into the inductive hypothesis. So if we prove the case of $\Oc_T$ we are done.
	- If $V_i=T$ then $d\pa{\Oc_T}=\deg V_i$, which is what we want in this case.
	- If $V_i\neq T$ then $0\to \Ic\to \Oc_T\to \Oc_{V_i}\to 0$ and since $d(\Oc_T)\leq d$, we get that $d(\Ic)<d$ since $d(\Oc_{V_i})=\deg V_i>0$. We are done by the exact sequence lemma.


If $\dim \Supp \Fc=0$ then $\deg \Fc=\dim H^0(\Fc)$. In the case that $\Fc=i_\ast \Oc_X$ with $\dim X$, this degree is the **number of points in $X$ counted with multiplicities**.
