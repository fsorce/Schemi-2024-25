#LocallyRingedSpace

Classical case with maximal spectrum of [[Very dense - Jacobson rings]]. 

We also want to account for nilpotents, non-algebraically closed fields and generally coefficients in different rings. We want [[Affine schemes]]. 

Schemes are [[Locally ringed space]] with a cover of affine schemes.

Open subset of scheme has a unique subscheme structure.
