#RelativeProperties

[[Fibered product]] with a morphism from new base to old base.

$X'=\Proj(R'\otimes_R A)=\Spec R'\times_{\Spec R}\Proj A=X_{R'}$.
- Build $X'\to X_{R'}\to X$ and verify that it is an isomorphism over the cover $X_f$.

A property $\Pc$ of a morphism $X\to Y$ is stable under base change if it passes to the parallel opposite side in a cartesian diagram.
