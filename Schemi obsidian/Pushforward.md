#Sheaves 

If $i:Y\inj X$ is [[Very dense - Jacobson rings|very dense]] then $i_\ast:\Sh(Y)\to \Sh(X)$ is an isomorphism of categories.

The pushforward of [[(Pre-)Sheaves of O_X-modules|O_X-modules]] via $f:X\to Y$ is a $\Oc_Y$-module.

The pushforward of [[Quasi-Coherent sheaves]] stays quasi-coherent when the morphism is [[Quasi-separated]] and quasi-compact.
- Affine case $\vp:A\to B$, $M\in \Mod_B$: $f_\ast\wt M=\wt{M}$ where in the RHS $M$ is seen as an $A$-module
- Case with [[Separated]] morphism: look at an affine cover. By separatedness the intersections are still affine so you can use the affine case together with the exact sequence properties.
- We did not do the general case.

If $X, Y$ are [[Noetherian schemes|locally Noetherian]], $f:X\to Y$ [[Finite morphisms]] or [[Proper morphisms]] then $f_\ast$ preserves [[Quasi-Coherent sheaves|coherent sheaves]].
