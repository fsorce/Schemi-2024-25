#LocallyRingedSpace

Topological space:
- Zariski topology. 
- The correspondence follows from $\sqrt I=\bigcap_{I\subseteq \pf}\pf$.
- It is quasi-compact, $T_0$ (so irreducible closed correspond to generic points). $\Spec_m$ gives closed points.
- Principal open are a basis

Structure [[Sheaves|sheaf]]:
- Stalks are $A_\pf$ with $\pf\in \Spec A$, take subsheaf of the sheaf of discontinuous sections.

This gives a functor $\Spec:\Ring\op\to \LRS$. 

[[Closed subschemes]] are given by $\Spec A/I$ with $I$ ideal.
