#LocallyRingedSpace

If $G$ is a group that acts on a scheme $X$ and the quotient as [[Locally ringed space]] is a scheme then we call this the quotient scheme.
When the quotient scheme exists it is the quotient in the category of schemes.

If $X/G$ exists and $U\subseteq X$ is open and stable under the action of $G$ then $U/G$ exists and it can be identified with the image of $U$ in $X/G$.

If $G$ is finite then the quotient of both [[Affine schemes]] and [[Proj construction|projective schemes]] by $G$ exist.
$(\Spec A)/G=\Spec A^G$ and $(\Proj A)/G=\Proj A^G$.
