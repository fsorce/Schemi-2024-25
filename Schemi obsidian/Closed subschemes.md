#Immersion

Closed subschemes are [[Closed immersions|closed subspaces]] of a scheme which are schemes.

Closed subschemes correspond to [[Sheaves of ideals]].


Unique [[Reduced schemes|reduced]] structure.
If $Y\subseteq X$ reduced closed subscheme then $\Ic_Y(U)=\cpa{f\in \Oc_X(U)\mid f(p)=0\ \forall p\in U\cpa Y}$.
