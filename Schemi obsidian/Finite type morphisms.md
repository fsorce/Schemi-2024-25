Locally of finite type over a ring $R$: for every open affine $U\subseteq X$ we have $\Oc(U)$ of finite type over $R$.
Finite type over $R$: locally of finite type and [[Quasi-compact]] (as topological space)

A morphism $f:X\to Y$ is (locally) of finite type if for all $V\subseteq Y$ affine, $f\ii(V)$ is (locally) of finite type over $\Oc(V)$.

$X\to \Spec R$ is (locally) of finite type iff $X$ is (locally) of finite type over $R$.


Locally of finite type is local on the domain.

Finite type is local on the base.
