[[Locally free sheaves|Line bundles]] on a projective scheme $X\to \Spec k$ are called very ample when they are the pullback of $\Oc_{\Pj^n_k}(1)$ via a closed immersion of the scheme in some $\Pj^n_k$.

A line bundle $L$ is very ample if and only if a basis of $H^0(X,L)$ defines a [[Morphisms to projective space|closed immersion in some projective space]].
- We already know that morphisms to $\Pj^n$ correspond to classes $(L,s_0,\cdots, s_n)$ obtained by pulling back $(\Oc_{\Pj^n}(1),x_0,\cdots, x_n)$, so $L$ is very ample.
- Suppose now that $L$ is very ample (so fix $X\to \Pj^n$ such that $L$ is the pullback of $\Oc(1)$) and that $s_0,\cdots, s_n$ are the pullbacks of $x_0,\cdots, x_n$.
- If these sections are not linearly independent and $\la_0s_0+\cdots+\la_n s_n=0$ is a non-trivial relation then the hyperplane $H=V(\la_0x_0+\cdots+\la_n x_n)$ contains the image of $X$. We may therefore substitute $\Pj^n$ with $H\cong \Pj^{n-1}$ since $\Oc_H(1)$ still pulls back to $L$.
- Iterating the previous step we may assume that the $s_0,\cdots,s_n$ are linearly independent.
- Complete the $s_0,\cdots, s_n$ to a basis of $H^0(X,L)$.

An immersion $X\to \Pj^n$ is degenerate is it factors through an hyperplane $H$.

The tensor product of very ample line bundles is very ample
- Use the fact that $\pr_1^\ast\Oc(1)\otimes \pr_2^\ast \Oc(1)$ is the pullback of $\Oc(1)$ via the Segre embedding.


An invertible sheaf $L$ is ample if there exists some $d>0$ such that $L^{\otimes d}$ is very ample, equivalently if $L^{\otimes d}$ is very ample for all $d\gg0$. (From now we write $L^d$ for $L^{\otimes d}$)

Let $L$ be an invertible sheaf on a projective $X\in\Sch/k$. TFAE
1. $L$ is ample
2. if $\Fc\in \Coh(X)$ then $\Fc\otimes L^d$ is generated by the global sections for $d\gg0$.
3. If $\Fc\in \Coh(X)$ then $H^i(X,\Fc\otimes L^d)=0$ for $i>0$ and $d\gg0$.
