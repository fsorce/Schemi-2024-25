#Sheaves 

$\Pre(\Oc_X)$ is an abelian category. The [[Sheaves]] form a subcategory $\Sh(\Oc_X)\subseteq \Pre(\Oc_X)$.

The sheafification inherits a unique $\Oc_X$-module structure from the original presheaf.

We can define a tensor product but it requires sheafification. It has the universal property of tensor product. The fibers are as expected:$$(\Fc\otimes_{\Oc_X}\Gc)_p\cong \Fc_p\otimes_{\Oc_{X,p}}\Gc_p.$$
An important class of $\Oc_X$-modules are [[Locally free sheaves]].

The most common type of $\Oc_X$-modules on schemes are [[Quasi-Coherent sheaves]].
