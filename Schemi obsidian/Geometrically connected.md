Let $X$ be a [[Proper morphisms|proper]] scheme over a field $k$. Note that $\Gamma(X,\Oc_X)$ is an Artinian $k$-algebra (we used properness).

It follows that $X$ is connected exactly when $\Gamma(X,\Oc_X)$ is local.

We say that $X$ is **geometrically connected** if $X_{k'}$ is connected for every field extension $k'/k$.

By [[Flat base change]] we see that $\Gamma(X_{k'}\Oc_{X_{k'}})\cong k'\otimes_k\Gamma(X,\Oc_X)$. From this we get
1. If $k=\ol k$ then $X$ connected iff geometrically connected
2. If $\Gamma(X,\Oc_X)=k$ then $X$ is geometrically connected.
